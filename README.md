## Description

Beer advisor is an application designed for the beer Connoisseur. It allows you to map out an efficient route to view all your brewery selections. The way it works is it asks the user to search for keywords or cities for a brewery list to populate. The user then can add breweries to their list. The user then will be prompted to add a starting and ending location. When the user clicks "map it" it will  display the most efficient route on a map.
